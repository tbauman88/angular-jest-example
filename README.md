# Integrate Jest into Angular CLI

This project was generated to integrate [Jest](https://github.com/facebook/jest) with the [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) v6.1.4.

## Why Jest?

Want to run your tests in the terminal instead of the browser?

What about running only the latest code changes?

Well you can do all this with Jest, as well it runs several times faster.

## Development server

Run `npm start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Running unit tests

Run `npm test` to execute the unit tests.
